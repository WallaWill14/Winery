This repository contains software to increase productivity for the winemakers.

Code is primarily python3, intended to run on MacOS or some variation of Ubuntu Linux.

GUIs are based on PyQt5 and the JPL_GUI_Engine by Mundo Guzman and Kyle Kung.

### tankCalc.py

This program calculates liquid volume in a fermentation tank (T1-T22).

In the future it can be used to generate a "daily report".
